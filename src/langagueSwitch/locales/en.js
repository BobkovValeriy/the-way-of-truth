      The little son came to his father,<br />

      <em>What is good and what is bad?</em><br />
      <strong>— V.V. Mayakovsky</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      This child's question seems simple at first glance, but behind it lies a deep philosophical dilemma.
      What does it really mean to do good? The entire history of humanity is full of contradictions and moral dilemmas.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Historical Context</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Imagine an ancient tribe leader. He gathered his band, attacked a neighboring tribe, destroyed all the men
      and elders, and enslaved the women and children. From the standpoint of modern Christian morality, this is clearly
      villainy. But the descendants of this leader, centuries later, may proudly consider their ancestor a great conqueror.
      Thanks to his actions, their society was able to survive and prosper. Ironically, they pray to Jesus,
      who preached love and forgiveness.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Modern Parallels</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      In the modern world, methods of appropriating someone else's labor have become more sophisticated, but the essence remains the same.
      Corporations absorb small businesses, economically strong countries exploit the resources of the weak.
      This brings good to some and misery to others. Even within one group of people, what is good for one may
      be bad for another.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>The Boundaries of Good and Evil</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      So how do we define what is good for everyone? Everything is too situational and subjective. But let's
      look at it from another perspective: what is definitely evil?
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      Death has always frightened people, and each person tries to compensate for this fear in their own way. Murder under certain
      conditions may be seen as good, but the death of all humanity is absolute evil. Actions
      that reduce humanity's chances of survival can be considered evil. Hence, everything that
      increases these chances is good.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Conclusion</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Therefore, I suggest we view moral questions through this lens: any action that contributes
      to the survival and flourishing of humanity can be considered good. This gives us a practical criterion
      for evaluating actions.

    <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
      God, grant me the strength to overcome what is necessary,<br />
      God, grant me the humility to accept the inevitable,<br />
      And the wisdom to distinguish between the two.<br />
      <strong>— My interpretation of a well-known prayer.</strong>
    </blockquote>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      At first glance, the statement that any actions that increase the chances of humanity's survival are good seems logical and pragmatic. 
      However, this statement requires a more detailed analysis.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Saving a Part of Society:</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      When it comes to humanity's survival, the situation can be quite straightforward. If the choice is between the extinction of all or saving 
      at least part of the reproductively capable population, then the good lies in saving this part. This may seem harsh, but in extreme situations, 
      such a choice becomes necessary. An example could be a global catastrophe scenario, where, in order to continue the human race, at least 
      a minimum number of people must be preserved.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Violation of Rights and Freedoms</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Definition of Freedom:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      The question of what freedom is is complex and multifaceted. In various situations, people are forced to sacrifice their rights and freedoms 
      for survival. At work, for example, we temporarily transfer some of our rights to our bosses to secure a livelihood.
      In different countries, there are restrictions on the display of certain body parts, and these restrictions vary depending on 
      cultural norms. People can only gain true freedom when they become independent from society, but this is unlikely in real 
      life conditions.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Long-term Consequences</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Unpredictability of the Future:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      We are not gods and cannot foresee all the consequences of our actions. Sometimes actions that seem good in the short term 
      can result in negative consequences in the future. However, this should not stop us from striving for survival.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Psychological and Sociocultural Aspects</h2>
    <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Culture and the Being of Society:</h3>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Culture, in essence, should serve the being of society, not be its foundation. Although the impoverishment of culture may seem 
      like an important issue, it should not overshadow the pursuit of survival. The most important aspect that deserves attention is 
      adherence to social justice. This is one of the cornerstones of society, and later in the book, we will examine it in more detail.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      Thus, actions aimed at increasing the chances of humanity's survival can be considered good. 
      But unfortunately, we are not immediately able to definitively determine which actions lead to the desired result. 
      For that, we must use our reason to anticipate some problems.

    A certain odd fellow still fights for the Truth,<br />
    The Truth in his words is worth no more than a penny:<br />
    <em>Pure Truth will triumph over time —<br />
    If it does the same as blatant Lies!</em><br />
    <strong>— Vladimir Vysotsky</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Everyone lies. This is obvious: distorting information becomes a convenient tool for personal gain.
    Through lies, one can avoid punishment for bad deeds, make less effort, and reap undeserved benefits.
    Humanity today is so powerful that it can fully compensate for the laziness of hundreds of millions of lazy liars
    and partially for billions more. Lies are a great tool for an easy life.
  </p>

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>The Cost of Lies</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    However, anyone who distorts information creates an imbalance in the social structure.
    Without knowing the real picture of resource production and misallocating these resources among consumers,
    society is doomed to face a crisis sooner or later. Historically, overcoming such crises often involves unpleasant
    forms of taking others' labor, including war in one form or another.
  </p>

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>What to Do?</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    Therefore, I see the elimination of the imbalance caused by pervasive lies as one of the steps toward survival.
    But I do not advocate for an absolute ban on lies, as benevolent lies indeed exist, and one must know how to use them
    and understand when good becomes harm.
  </p>

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Truth or Honesty?</h2>

<p className={styles.text}>
  Society, assembly, group — in our world, there are many words in all languages 
  describing the phenomenon of uniting people for joint actions. But how do these societies differ? 
  What actions do they take? The difference seems small, 
  each society has something unique, but in general, their essence is — for all good against all bad.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>Why is society needed?</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
  Why do people need society? The answer lies in a simple truth — survival is easier together. 
  Many millennia ago, people realized that staying outside society meant doom. 
  There are exceptions, but they only prove the rule — without society, a person faces death and oblivion. 
  This deep desire to unite is what drives people to form societies. 
  There may be various situational deviations caused by manipulation or traditions, 
  but any society that does not care for its members is doomed to death.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>How to distinguish the right society?</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
  To distinguish the right direction of society's development from the wrong one, we must return to the concept of good. 
  A society that increases humanity's chances of survival acts rightly. 
  If it performs actions that decrease or deprive humanity of its chances of survival, it is going the wrong way.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>Principles of society</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
  From everything stated, it follows that every society must adhere to two principles:
</p>
<ol className={styles.list}>
  <li>Caring for society members (and therefore increasing humanity's chances of survival as a whole).</li>
  <li>Protecting the structure of society (a society without established mechanisms of interaction, in other words, power, is also doomed).</li>
</ol>

chapter6: `

  <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
    Power doesn't come from the people!<br />
    Don't repeat these foolish ideas written in the Constitution!<br />

    And through its executions!<br />
    <strong>— Pavel Plamenyev</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    For a society that wishes to continue its existence, there must be a structure through which the individuals 
    who make up the society can interact with each other. This structure in our language can be called power. 
    Power is primarily the ability of one individual to make another individual carry out their desire.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Power can be considered by the nature of its origin, but in any case, regardless of its origin, its implementation 
    depends primarily on the belief of those being governed that it is correct.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    If you need money, and you go to work for it, you are being made to perform certain actions necessary for someone else. 
    Money is a way of transferring power impulses. One person wants another person to do something, and pays them for it. 
    Essentially, money is one of the ways to exercise power.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Another way of exercising power is belief. A faith leader believes their followers should perform certain actions. 
    It doesn't matter what those actions are — what matters is that, in the end, one individual imposes their desires onto another.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    And in both the case of money and belief, the main motive is to make people believe that they need to act according 
    to someone else's will. Essentially, money is as much a matter of belief as Christian religions, for example. 
    There are many such examples. And with every example, the same fact becomes clear — power exists when people believe in it.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Power is impossible when a person knows that they can get what they want without it.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Power is possible when a person believes that without it they won't get what they need.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    The question is, is it good or bad that some people submit to others? 
    Every time this question arises, it's worth considering what has caused it.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    The issue is that group labor is much more efficient than individual labor. Any healthy person is capable of mastering 
    any part of any production chain, but no one is capable of doing everything, let alone making everything. For example, 
    to hunt a mammoth, it needs to be struck 300 times in 1 minute. No single person could manage this alone; a group of people 
    is needed to strike simultaneously.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    How do you do it? Our ancestors came up with dividing roles between commanders and subordinates 
    (regardless of what they were called at the time) as the simplest solution. At the command to strike, 
    a group successfully kills a mammoth. They have food — the function of power is complete, and power can retreat until new 
    organizational efforts are needed. But this worked only as long as the results of the labor were known to those performing it.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    But if, for example, building a house requires 1000 bricks, the manager can easily convince subordinates 
    that they need to make 1100 bricks. As a result, more labor is spent, the group gets the same benefit (the house), 
    and the manager is left with 100 bricks to do whatever they want with.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Essentially, for power to remain intact, it must constantly perform a useful societal function of management for the survival 
    of that society (this goal is the primary goal of any society). All other goals of society are imposed by its own power.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    To fulfill the desires of an individual, power is applied in society.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Or, to fulfill an individual's desires, society must believe that those desires should be fulfilled.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    If society has no issues with basic needs, an individual can use the belief of this society to achieve goals beyond the 
    desires of that society, according to their own personal views.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    The question of the legitimacy of power arises when:
    <br />
    1. Basic desires of society are unmet
    <br />
    2. The desires of other powerful members of society are unmet.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    In the first case, the individual with power has used it unwisely, squandering it on their own desires at the expense of society.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    In the second case, another individual desires additional power to fulfill their own desires.

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Previously, we discussed two important questions about the nature of power and virtuous actions.
    Now it's time to focus on what drives people to act in one way or another.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Desire. There was a comrade Freud, who always sought the "animal" component in the motivations of human
    actions, and undoubtedly, this component is present directly or indirectly in many human actions (for
    example, as a result of morning runs, a person gains control over certain physical parameters, which in
    turn leads to increased attention from the opposite sex, which in turn increases the chances of satisfying
    the desire for reproduction). However, there are actions that are explicitly directed at the self-destruction
    of the society in which the specific person lives, or at the elimination of the person from the competitive
    struggle within that society.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Most often, such desires are caused by manipulations with human consciousness, where a "correct" behavior
    is created in a person's mind in ways that contradict basic "instincts". Ultimately, such destructive behavior
    serves to satisfy other people's "animal" instincts at the expense of individuals who voluntarily withdraw from
    the competitive struggle after falling for manipulation. Our nature, through feelings, gives us an understanding
    of what we need, and the awareness of these feelings is what gives rise to Desires.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    As a result, every person has their own vision of the situation and the desired transformation of it into
    a sequence of events where the person will be better off. If a person cannot properly determine what is
    happening, they will not be able to understand what needs to be done to get the desired outcome. One form
    of power, and the most skillful among them all, is the power over desires. If manipulations with wages, 
    intimidation with force, or fear of the afterlife judgment are more or less clear to society, and the method
    of combating these manipulations is conceptually understood, though not yet fully resolved, the struggle with
    false desires has not only not begun, but is also not recognized by society in its mass. Undoubtedly, we cannot
    say that the formation of Desires in society is organized in the worst possible way, but if society's eyes
    are not opened to the lie it lives by and for, it will eventually lead to an imbalance in resource distribution
    among people, and since humanity is becoming more powerful, the risk of self-destruction is increasing.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    To prevent our extinction as a species, society must get rid of false desires. To form viable desires,
    truth is needed — on the basis of which each person will make a choice for themselves. And if a person is not
    mentally ill, they will certainly make the right choice. They will certainly have the right desires.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    How to distinguish a right desire from a wrong one? To do this, you can trace the chain of connections
    until it becomes clear which of the instincts will be satisfied as a result of fulfilling a certain desire.
    If one of your instincts is not satisfied, it means that someone else's desire is being fulfilled. And then
    you can decide whether it is worth desiring what you currently want.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    After all, people by nature possess such a trait as laziness, and would rather not do something unnecessary
    than do it. Therefore, any action must be justified at least from the position of laziness, not to mention
    some personal or common good.

  <blockquote className={styles.quote}>
  Look! Look!<br />
  Behind the boy, like a shadow,<br />
  Laziness sneaks step by step.<br />
  <strong>— Davydova T.</strong>
</blockquote>

<p className={styles.text}>
  And so, we’ve reached laziness and idleness — in the vast number of reflections on laziness generated by humanity, 
  there are many useful examples for us, but I won’t list them here...
</p>

<p className={styles.text}>
  Let’s consider the following:
  <ul>
    <li>fifteen hundred years ago, many peasants used manual labor to plow the land;</li>
    <li>two hundred years ago, many peasants used horse-drawn plows to plow the land;</li>
    <li>nowadays, many peasants use tractors to plow the land.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p className={styles.text}>
  It can be concluded that peasants are working less and less! Yet they produce more and more food. 
  So, are they lazy or not? The fact is that laziness is not evil in itself. Laziness is a feeling 
  that helps a person in their existence; it is meant to help us recognize unnecessary waste of our 
  energy. Without laziness, progress in many areas of our economy would have been impossible. 
  So, does it mean that millions of people fighting laziness are wasting their time? Could it be that 
  losing the battle with laziness might lead humanity to extinction?
</p>

<p className={styles.text}>
  Laziness should be overcome in specific cases rather than completely excluded from life. 
  And this struggle should not be waged by deforming one’s nature, turning into a workaholic incapable 
  of distinguishing productive work from monkey-like labor. Since laziness is a feeling, it can only 
  be overcome by stronger feelings born from your desires. Laziness actually becomes stronger the further 
  your activity is from your desires. But as soon as laziness stands against your desires, it will immediately 
  flee in disgrace. Fighting laziness should really be about finding interests, not blindly inflating willpower.

    <p className={styles.text}>
      We are constantly told that willpower helps in achieving goals. But there's a question — remember, what kind of feeling does using this force give you? It's quite pleasant, right? It's like going to the bathroom when there's nothing to use. Here's the catch — you have to apply willpower when your actions go against your desires. And when does that happen? When your intended actions are imposed not by your desires.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      Therefore, a person who, by their own will, for example, climbs Everest, has not demonstrated willpower. Willpower was more likely demonstrated by those who helped carry the equipment. Although they did this, guided by their desire to earn money. Willpower can be trained by forcing yourself to do things that are uninteresting, undesirable, and so on. But if we recall our reasoning about desires, it turns out that willpower is a tool for exercising power over you. Therefore, any application of this force is a litmus test by which the influence exerted on you can be determined.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      But don't rush to give up everything and indulge in laziness. This is just one of the signals for reflection: do you need the action imposed by society, or perhaps it's better to focus on what really matters to you? As soon as you understand the benefit of this action and feel the desire to act, the need to overcome yourself will disappear. Or you will realize that it's simply not needed.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Psychological Consequences</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Using willpower, you need to understand that what you are striving for by using it is unlikely to bring you joy. Most likely, as a result of willful efforts, you will acquire something that is necessary for survival. Your feelings may be compensated by the rewards you gain from the effort, but you will only live like this out of desperation, and there's a risk of falling into the destructive process that is now commonly called depression.
    </p>

    <p className={styles.text}>
      Depression is a state where you don't want to do anything because you have lost your direction (your desires, caused by your feelings). Unfortunately, I am neither a specialist nor an experienced person in the matter of overcoming depression, but I explain how people fall into it. If you constantly use willpower, you are not following your desires. You stop wanting anything and, accordingly, you do not experience positive feelings. And the best source of energy is your feelings. As soon as you run out of energy for your activities, you will likely have to change them.
    </p>

    <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Conclusion</h2>
    <p className={styles.text}>
      Depression is like the body's protective mechanism against excessive use of willpower. Therefore, when using willpower, you need to understand that it is a signal to reflect: have you become too engrossed in imposed goals? Try to find a balance between willful efforts and your true desires to live in harmony with yourself.

  <p className={styles.text}>
    The power over desires is the most sophisticated of all the powers I know. Let's break down how it works. Earlier, we partially touched on this issue and also made a small detour talking about things like laziness and will. Thus, we arrived at the source of all desires — emotions. Laziness, joy, sorrow, anger, and other feelings are necessary for everyone. In fact, feelings act as instruments by which we navigate through our lives.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Each of us desires to experience positive emotions and does not wish to experience negative ones. As soon as we start feeling negative emotions, it signals us to think: what is wrong? What needs to be changed in our lives so that we do not experience these "unpleasant, terrible" emotions? When experiencing positive emotions, we understand that everything is going right from our perspective. But there is a small nuance: we are not born with a clear list of "event — emotion" connections. I am not mistaken in mentioning personal perspective. Like any instrument, our emotions need to undergo periodic calibration. I can’t name the exact intervals for this, but they are undoubtedly necessary.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    And it is precisely at the moment of calibration of our emotions that external influences can creep into our consciousness. It is not always absolutely negative; often, it even helps to define what is good and what is bad. However, modern technologies now allow the distortion of instrument readings. For instance, you are subtly convinced through the media that your ancestors did something bad, causing feelings of guilt, and immediately the desire to redeem that guilt is formulated.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Or they tell you that you must raise your children in a certain way, and then they will be happy — covering this with your own childhood feelings when the world seemed incomprehensible and frightening, and your parents' behavior seemed illogical (feelings of distrust, doubt). There are many examples like this. To form the desired actions in a leader, they need to manipulate through feelings, through the substitution of emotional responses to events. For a while, people can be made to act against their true nature.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    But our bodies are very wise: we have many emotions, and none of them has been fully controlled by any manipulator so far. Discrepancy between various emotional states creates inner conflict, which forces people to reflect on the correctness of their emotional settings. Is it right to feel joy from the death of your enemy’s child? After all, they will grow up and possibly take revenge... Is it right not to punish your child for bullying the weak? After all, they may also take revenge...
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Is it right to do everything for your child? After all, they are so special... You are being controlled through your emotions, but you can also control yourself using this vulnerability. If desires are distinguished from imposed ones by the effort you put into realizing them, the more effort you put into realizing a desire, the further it is from your true goals and aspirations.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    How to distinguish imposed emotions from personal ones? In each case, it is necessary to consider all nuances. However, the universal key to solving this task I have already mentioned, though not entirely explicitly. Since survival at this stage of development requires society, which undoubtedly has to care about the survival of its components (people), the emotional settings that allow people to live harmoniously within this society and with themselves will be correct.

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Manipulation through Emotions</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    But when contradictions in people’s emotions begin to emerge widely in society, this is a clear sign of manipulation aimed at their feelings. If such manipulations exist, it means there are discrepancies between the official course of the society's leaders and the real desires of the people under their rule. It means that either there is a group of leaders trying to achieve their desires by redistributing power, or the current rulers have misused their power and failed to achieve the result their authority justified.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Everything that triggers emotions in you can be used against you. Emotions triggered by children are among the strongest, which is why manipulation through children is highly effective.

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>The Impact of Parenting on Future Generations</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    Besides what we discussed earlier, the way we raise children shapes the future of society by creating leverages for influential structures. Not only are you, as parents, frightened by the distorted fates of unfortunate children whose upbringing was poor and who are forced to follow self-proclaimed parenting experts, but over time, the authorities gain more obedient citizens in the spheres they need. And I am not talking about the commonly recognized authorities of states. I’m talking about those who truly control, whether it's a country's president or an unknown oligarch.

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>The Illusion of Protection from Violence</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    We are endlessly told that violence is bad, and if children are exposed to violence, it’s a catastrophe for society, and we must immediately consult a psychologist. But let’s think for a moment: have people not faced violence for thousands of years? And children? Did it stop humanity from going to space? Did violence prevent the industrial revolution? Or perhaps the ancestors of those trying to abolish violence didn’t rob or kill their enemies? Violence is one of the tools of human interaction. And we need to know how to use it. By shielding children from violence, you make them defenseless against it. Like any tool, violence has certain rules for use. Breaking those rules creates imbalance and leads society toward extinction. When several healthy men cannot stop an unarmed criminal assaulting a woman in front of them, that’s a very worrying sign. A child who faces violence is certainly scared because they don’t know what to do. But they will be just as scared at 30 if they haven’t learned how to use violence as a tool.

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Contradictions in Society: Family as the Enemy</h2>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    We are told not to impose our worldview on children, not to control them, and that we should create a golden cage for them, allowing them to develop into a person. But in reality, we are made to feel incapable of raising children by our own “personal” rules, leaving the upbringing to others. Should we then be surprised when our children go in the wrong direction? Should we be surprised by low birth rates in countries where parents must become professors before having children? A few hundred years ago, children were seen as investments (as harsh as that sounds), but today it becomes harder and harder to look at children as anything but a bundle of problems and stress. Despite all the declarations, family is the enemy for most modern ruling circles.

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Family as a Foundation</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        The family is the most fundamental unit of human unification. Since ancient times, the most important processes for 
        human survival and the survival of the human race have taken place within the family: accumulation and distribution of 
        resources, reproduction of the species, and the transmission of knowledge passed down by ancestors.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Family as the Enemy of the Ruling Circles</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        So why is the family the enemy of the ruling circles? Regardless of whether the society is socialist or capitalist, 
        these are simply forms of control over people. For your government, it is important that you perform the duties 
        assigned to you. For this, you must either believe that you are doing the right thing, or have no ability to resist the 
        impulses of the ruling power. In both cases, the family undermines the monopoly of power. Families act as a parallel 
        power branch, and the more united people are within their families, the harder it is to govern them.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Modern Societies and Power</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Nowadays, societies are divided into socialist, capitalist, and dictatorial regimes, but in all of them, power 
        is still maintained within families. This means that those who have reached the highest power will eventually 
        use it to deceitfully ensure that benefits are available to the ruling family members. And where resources are plentiful, 
        people multiply, and the larger the family, the greater its need for resources. The more power is misused to 
        unjustly redistribute resources, the more people will oppose such a family. However, if families are broken up, 
        people's resistance will be much weaker.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Destruction of the Family: Is It Good or Bad?</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Is the destruction of the family good or bad for humanity? By diluting the concept of family, people become more 
        defenseless against the arbitrary actions of the government, but at the same time, they become harder to control 
        in another sense. Many people do not need excessive wealth for happiness, and it is much harder to force them to work 
        while neglecting their families. This is why global elites are caught between two fires: destroying the family completely 
        means eliminating a huge source of motivation for millions of people, but allowing families to hold too much power over 
        their members creates competition. Hence the many contradictory laws, like "you must give everything to your children, 
        but they owe you nothing."
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Problems with Inherited Power</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Also, in societies where power is inherited, successors tend to be weaker. Competition fosters development, but 
        in the case of heirs to rulers, competition is much lower than in regular conditions and shifts to other planes, 
        disconnected from the real needs of people.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Socialism as a Solution</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        To solve these problems, socialism was developed by wise people. In it, individuals are separated from their families 
        in various ways, and they are supposed to use their talents to manage society for its benefit. But a group of people, 
        united by family ties, will eventually defeat even the most genius individual in the competition for power. Thus, the cycle 
        will close, and everything will begin anew.
      </p>

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>What Is the Way Out?</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        So what is the way out of this endless cycle of power?
      </p>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Let's imagine that families do not exist at all:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The management of resource extraction and distribution for the survival of newborns is handled by government officials.</li>
        <li>Newborns grow up in organizations dedicated to their upbringing.</li>
        <li>The process of human reproduction is limited to DNA combinations, excluding undesirable mutations (people do not even need to know that they are relatives - sex is possible, but without conception, decisions are based on DNA chips embedded under the skin).</li>
        <li>In such a society, people will likely hold positions based on their abilities.</li>
        <li>This society is protected from the transmission of power through inheritance, as whatever an individual takes from others will eventually either return to society or be lost and cease to affect others.</li>
        <li>Since family is an association of people based on kinship, its absence does not solve the issue of people uniting in groups, such as “blue-eyed locksmiths” who will use their power to redistribute resources for their benefit. Therefore, there will still be an imbalance and irresponsible consumption of resources where possible.</li>
        <li>In such a society, great effort would be spent tracking constantly forming human groups, which in turn would create fertile ground for the emergence of groups like “chief overseers.”</li>
        <li>As for the emergence of a society of “common children,” it must be fueled by people's awareness of its "potential usefulness" and then legislatively approved. However, such a society must remain closed to foreign elements; otherwise, it will inevitably lose the battle for resources by admitting advocates of hereditary power. Therefore, the emergence of such a society is extremely difficult, as it requires many coincidences to happen for it to form.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Return to the Family</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        Now imagine that the concept of family (or clan) with a clear vertical structure of power inside it returns to society.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Resource distribution will likely be more loyal within these families.</li>
        <li>The ruling circles will still emerge from families, but their power will not be as absolute as it is under the current world order.</li>
        <li>The probability of power redistribution within society will increase, and various coups will happen, so legislation will be needed to maintain balance between families.</li>
        <li>Such societies already existed in the past and are preserved in governing structures today. As a result of such societies, it is inevitable that one family, after being in power for a long time, will start a war with other families to seize their resources, and if they succeed, all resources of society will be again subordinated to the ruling circles, which will eventually lead to another revolution.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className={styles.subheading}>Conclusion</h2>
      <p className={styles.text}>
        As we can see, the family is a very complex issue for society, and no solution to the family question is perfect. But as long as we exist as a species, it is within our power to maintain any type of society, and for that, constant work must be done on every member of society, including those in power. This work is called education.

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Education helps to reconcile with the imperfections of each specific societal model. When people are faced with an unfair distribution of resources, they can cultivate qualities in future generations that help them accept this situation. And education will work as long as the person is at least not hungry. However, by endlessly oppressing some parts of society to ensure prosperity in others, sooner or later the ruling circles will make fatal mistakes in resource distribution. How do people typically solve these problems? The elites, realizing they cannot fulfill the masses’ desires, admit that resources are lacking, but blame someone else. War begins, and all problems are blamed on it. Centuries ago, the same thing happened, but without such refined manipulation, as leaders of certain societies simply called their people to plunder neighbors for their own well-being. So, what kind of education are we talking about if all forms of education previously pushed people to ignore the injustices happening around them? I propose education through truth. Of course, no one can know the entire truth, but everyone possesses a part of it. Education should lay the foundation for an individual’s survival in society, while society itself must ensure the survival of its members. In any case, resources are limited, and sooner or later either we will discover the principles granting humanity immortality, or humanity will perish. It is in the education of future generations that our immortality or oblivion lies.

  <h2 className={styles.subheading}>What qualities are needed for our successors?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Logical thinking</strong>: This is, in my opinion, the most important quality of a person. Without an effective tool for understanding the world around us, no other positive traits can be developed.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility of thought</strong>: What I mean is that a person should understand the limitations of their knowledge. Having knowledge in one area does not make someone an expert in all aspects of life. They must understand that they do not know everything and may be wrong in their judgments. One should not immediately reject another opinion on a situation. It is necessary to use logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Ability to defend one's opinion</strong>: When the volume of one's knowledge is sufficient to understand cause-and-effect relationships, and new data contradict previous knowledge, one should not blindly agree with others’ opinions. One should use logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal setting</strong>: The ability of a person to use logic to determine their own goals and the necessary steps to achieve them.</li>
    <li><strong>Charity</strong>: The ability to pursue personal goals in alignment with the greater good. A person's goals should not contradict the principle of humanity's survival. Any actions leading to humanity's extinction should be seen negatively.</li>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    Based on my reasoning, it seems that building society on the foundation of family values almost inevitably leads to 
    a skewed distribution of resources within society. For a time, various methods may be used to quench people's discontent 
    with injustices, but sooner or later, this will lead to war.
  </p>

  <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Possible Solutions</h3>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    One solution I see is the gradual transformation of the institution of private families into the institution of state 
    guardianship in education. This will not increase the available resources, but their distribution will no longer be as 
    glaringly unfair.
  </p>

  <p className={styles.text}>
    However, another danger arises: the effectiveness of our modern family structure has been proven for millennia. Our societies 
    have been built upon this structure.
  </p>

  <h3 className={styles.subheading}>Difficulties and Risks</h3>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    Another solution would be to attempt to educate the next generations within the principles I described in the previous chapter, 
    inside families. However, it would be overly naive to believe that such education guarantees correct resource management in society.
    The families in power are unlikely to be interested in raising their descendants in such a way.
  </p>

  <h3 className={styles.subheading}>New Challenges</h3>
  <p className={styles.text}>
    Stepping into a new era, we will face new challenges we have never encountered before. 
    Whether humanity will survive this is unknown. They say the criterion of truth is experiment, and most likely, 
    only the confrontation of two approaches to human reproduction will give us the answer to which one is more viable.

    Even after considering just a few questions, the reader may already have the impression that the range of tasks and areas of activity is vast. Moreover, this list of tasks remains indefinite. 
    So how can one achieve sustainable balance in society, in family, and, most importantly, in one’s own thoughts?
</p>

<p className={styles.text}>
    In this book, as the author, I have tried to uncover the fundamental principle of coexistence, development, and survival of humanity by illustrating my reasoning with examples. When encountering new knowledge, 
    none of us should blindly copy it; rather, we should filter it through our own consciousness and use it to shape our own vision of reality. 
    Anyone who reads this book and understands its core message—that good is what increases humanity’s chances of survival—will be able to apply this principle in everyday life.
</p>

<p className={styles.text}>
    There is no need to immediately identify all possible good deeds. Simply live with this idea, and it will naturally help shape your beliefs. 
    After all, people change. Long ago, the current social structure of society seemed unimaginable. But with every voiced opinion and every realized fact, 
    people moved toward the present state of affairs. It is still far from perfect, but each of us reshapes our understanding of good and evil throughout life—both in our own minds and in those around us.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>The Impact of Each of Us</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
    Every time you perform an action that is right from the perspective of good, you change the world. 
    Even if just a little, even if imperceptibly to yourself, these changes exist. 
    Even those in power are influenced by them, as they cannot completely ignore the moral and cultural values of the societies they govern.
</p>

<p className={styles.text}>
    Ultimately, this book is also written for them, because power is granted for the benefit of humanity. 
    By making choices in the right direction, they fulfill their duty to future generations, and their posthumous legacy will never fade. 
    And this applies not only to leaders of large social structures—every person changes the world around them. 
    Together, we are the creators. And the most important thing is to realize what is good.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>Creating a Community</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
    In the future, I plan to create a community to discuss various issues based on the principle of good that I have formulated. 
    I am not a god and cannot comprehend all possible questions. But together, we are equal to a creator, and over time, these discussions will undoubtedly improve our world.
</p>

<h2 className={styles.subheading}>Useful Tools</h2>
<p className={styles.text}>
    One of the key tasks I see is compiling a list of useful applications for life, since I am a programmer and involved in this field. 
    For example, here is a budgeting program I created:
</p>

<p className={styles.link}>
    <a href="https://budget-sigma-sable.vercel.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        budget-sigma-sable.vercel.app
    </a>
</p>

<p className={styles.text}>
    What is the essence of this program in relation to the principle of good? 
    We often wonder why our life turns out the way it does, why we fail to afford certain things. 
    By using this program or a similar one, you can determine where your resources are going. 
    After all, the results of your efforts always depend on the effort invested. 
    By tracking expenses, you will see what is not aligning with your expectations.
</p>

<p className={styles.text}>
    Thank you for your attention. Together, we will make the world a better place. I won’t say goodbye, 
    as your thoughts will surely continue to develop this project.
